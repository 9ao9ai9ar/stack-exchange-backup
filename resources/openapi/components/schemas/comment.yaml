  All Questions and Answers on a Stack Exchange site can be commented on, and this type represents those comments.

  Comments can also be optionally directed at users, when this is the case the reply_to_user property is set (if it is requested in the current filter).

  The upvoted field can only be queried for with an access_token with the private_info scope.
