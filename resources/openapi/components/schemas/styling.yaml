  This type represents some stylings of a site in the Stack Exchange network.

  These stylings are meant to allow developers to subtly vary the presentation of resources in their applications so as to indicate to users the original source site.

  Applications should be able to gracefully handle these styles changes, though they can safely assume that these style changes are infrequent.

  Note that colors can be returned either as six or three digit hex triplets.
